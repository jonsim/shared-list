# Shared List

A very basic website for sharing lists between a group of users. Originally
designed for sharing and co-ordinating a present list among a group of people
without disclosing information to the requestors. This was to remedy a
shortcoming in all currently available shared document platforms which don't
allow setting permissions at a finer granularity than document level.

Intended to be sufficiently minimalist and general purpose to be easily
extensible to add to at a later date.
